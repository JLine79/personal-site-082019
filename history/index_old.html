      </div>

      <div>
        <p>I have a degree in International Business with Italian, and more learn-by-doing-life-lessons than I can recount. I have experience and training in:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Monitoring, Evaluation &amp; Learning</li>
            <li>Leadership &amp; collaboration</li>

        <div>
          <p>Lots of people seem to hate data. Not me. I love a good spreadsheet. Excel, Tableau, SPSS and Access are my friends. </p>
          <p>I can dive into that mess of spreadsheets you've been squirrelling away, work out what your Google Analytics are telling you, or find some good old secondary datasets to provide you with some perspective, so that you can make confident, informed decisions.</p>

        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Project Management is the theme that has run most consistently through my career. I've run localisation projects for international clients, produced research, delivered funded projects and annual awards.</p>
          <p>And, as a mother of 3 my life is basically never-ending project management &lpar;I know you know what I mean, fellow parents&rpar;.</p>
          <p>Basically, I have exceptional organisational skills. Inbox zero anyone?</p>

        </div>

        <div>
          <p>I have worked with people enough to know you can't get anywhere without them. I took a course in facilitation, and practiced putting theory into practice. </p>
          <p>I can help bring people together, bring views out into the open and navigate ways through differences to the common ground underneath. I will work with you to design and run sessions to draw out experiences, understand perspectives and reach decisions.</p>

        </div>

        <div>
          <p>I'm somewhere between an introvert and an extrovert when it comes to people. In practice, this means that I can nurture conversations effectively, but then shut up long enough to hear and reflect on what's being said. </p>
          <p>My professional history with people includes advocacy for affordable housing and community led housing, line management, event facilitation, network management and board membership.</p>

            <h3>Housing Expertise</h3>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Until very recently my career was focused on housing. I've been involved in many different things including:

              <li>Strategic enabling</li>
              <li>Running consultations &amp; events</li>

            </ul>
          <p>I'm also currently vice-chair of Leicestershire Rural Housing Association.</p>
